# JimmsOtherCalibrePlugins

This is a repository for me to keep my 'other' calibre plugins, IE, not
[FanFicFare](../../../FanFicFare), [EpubMerge](../../../EpubMerge), [EpubSplit](../../../EpubSplit) and [SmartEject](../../../SmartEject).

You're welcome to try using these, but I'm not going to offer very much support.

## Other People's Plugins

ViewManager, FavouritesMenu, etc

As of October 2022, kiwidude is actively maintaining his plugins again.  See [kiwidude68/calibre_plugins](https://github.com/kiwidude68/calibre_plugins).  The versions here are already out of date and will be removed in future.
