# JimmsOtherCalibrePlugins

This is a repository for me to keep my 'other' calibre plugins, IE, not
[FanFicFare](../../../FanFicFare), [EpubMerge](../../../EpubMerge), [EpubSplit](../../../EpubSplit) and [SmartEject](../../../SmartEject).

You're welcome to try using these, but I'm not going to offer very much support.

## Other People's Plugins

As of October 2022, kiwidude is actively maintaining his plugins again.  See [kiwidude68/calibre_plugins](https://github.com/kiwidude68/calibre_plugins).

The versions of FavouritesMenu GenerateCover ManageSeries ReadingList and ViewManager kept here are now removed, but can be seen in their last state in the [last_with_kiwidudes_plugins branch](https://github.com/JimmXinu/JimmsOtherCalibrePlugins/tree/last_with_kiwidudes_plugins).
